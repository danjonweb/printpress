The story of Printpress
==========
Printpress is a native Mac client to manage your WordPress blogs, written mostly in Objective-C. It used WebKit's powerful contenteditable="true" to make editing your blog's HTML as easy as editing rich text. It also supported managing your image library and inserting images into posts. This was version 1.x, my first attempt at creating a full-fledged Mac app in my spare time. Some of the code dates back to when I was in college and first learning Objective-C, and is a little rough. I decided rather than try to patch the existing, poor code base into a decent 2.0 release, I should rewrite Printpress from the ground up using more modern technologies like ARC and GCD. I currently have no timeline for release.
